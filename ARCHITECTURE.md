### Deployment Gate (Stage 9)

**Stage 9: Authorization Engine**
- Component: `AuthorizationEngine.tsx`

  - Compliance Officer (Optional)
  - Technical Lead (Optional)

- **Deployment Decisions:**
  - Full Deployment
  - Staged Rollout
  - Pilot Program
  - Conditional Approval
  - Deployment Blocked

- **Authorization Certificate:**
  - Immutable cryptographic certificate

  - 90-day validity period
  - Downloadable JSON format

- **Deployment Conditions:**
  - Pre-deployment checklist
  - Verification tracking
  - Required/optional indicators

- **Audit Trail:**
  - Immutable log of all actions
  - Cryptographic hash chain
  - Complete who/what/when tracking

**Output:** GO/NO-GO decision with formal authorization certificate

### Post-Deployment (Stage 10)

**Stage 10: Continuous Monitoring**
- Component: `ContinuousMonitoring.tsx`
- Purpose: Real-time post-deployment monitoring and incident response
- Database: `monitoring_streams`, `monitoring_metrics`, `incidents`, `automated_responses`, `infrastructure_health`, `alert_notifications`

**Features:**
- **Real-Time Monitoring Streams:**
  - Drift detection
  - Bias monitoring
  - Safety guardrails
  - Performance tracking
  - Content moderation
  - Security monitoring

- **Incident Management:**
  - Automated incident detection
  - Response team coordination
  - Governance escalation workflows
  - Root cause analysis
  - Resolution tracking

- **Infrastructure Health:**
  - CPU, memory, network, storage monitoring
  - Multi-region support
  - Instance health checks
  - Capacity planning

- **Automated Responses:**
  - Trigger-based mitigation
  - Auto-escalation
  - Effectiveness scoring
  - Learning from incidents

- **Alert Notifications:**
  - Multi-channel alerts (email, Slack, SMS, webhook)
  - Severity-based routing
  - Delivery tracking
  - Alert audit trail

**Output:** Continuous operational monitoring with automated incident response

## Reference & Tools

**NIST RMF Reference**
- Component: `RMFValidAIteMapping.tsx`
- Purpose: NIST AI Risk Management Framework overview and mapping

**Control Library**
- Component: `ControlLibrary.tsx`
- Purpose: Browse all Algorithmic Control Catalog (ACC) controls

**Metric Catalog**
- Component: `MetricsThresholdDashboard.tsx`
- Purpose: All trust metrics defined with thresholds

**Evidence Export**
- Component: `EvidencePackGenerator.tsx`
- Purpose: Generate compliance evidence bundles

## Database Architecture

### Application Setup Schema
- Tables: `applications`, `use_cases`, `stakeholders`, `archetype_classification`
- Purpose: Store application configuration and archetype classification

### Authorization Schema
- Tables: `authorization_requests`, `stakeholder_approvals`, `deployment_conditions`, `authorization_decisions`, `authorization_certificates`, `authorization_audit_trail`
- Purpose: Formal authorization workflow with multi-stakeholder approval

### Continuous Monitoring Schema
- Tables: `monitoring_streams`, `monitoring_metrics`, `incidents`, `automated_responses`, `infrastructure_health`, `alert_notifications`
- Purpose: Post-deployment monitoring and incident management

### Security
- All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Restrictive policies: users can only access authorized data
- Audit trails are immutable and cryptographically linked
- Certificates are publicly readable but not modifiable
